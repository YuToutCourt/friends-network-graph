# Social-network-graph

 Create a network graph of your friends on a social media.  
 Inspired by [humboldt123](https://github.com/humboldt123/mutuals)

## Warning ⚠️

This project uses your discord token to scan your mutual friends list. However, never, ever, under any circumstances give your token to anybody as it would give them full access to your account. Before running this program, I highly recommend reading through the code to make sure it is something you trust.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+ with pip (you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- A web browser

## Setup

After installing Python, download this repository [here](https://github.com/arnaud-ma/friends-network-graph/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or clone it.  

Navigate to it with a terminal then run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install its dependencies and ```py start.py``` to run it.

Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal. Creating the graph can take several tens of seconds so please wait when a blank page appears.

You may be asked to give your discord token.  
⚠️BEFORE DOING ANYTHING READ THE WARNING SECTION ⚠️  
To get it, log into Discord on a browser. Open Developer Tools, then click Network. Press F5 on your keyboard to reload the page. Type /api into the Filter field, then click library. Click the Headers tab, then scroll down to authorization to find your Discord token.

## Personalization

You can personalize the graph by editing the ```options.json``` file. You can find all possible customizations in the documentation [here](https://visjs.github.io/vis-network/docs/network/#options).  
For example if nodes fidget too much, you can decrease the value of ```springConstant```

For even more customization, it is possible to modify the file ```graph.js``` at the twentieth line.  
For example if nodes are too small or big, you can change the ```size``` argument (or even delete it).
